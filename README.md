# hey-thats-my-fish
Recreating Hey That's My Fish board game in Java

Program that allows 2 players to play “Hey That’s My Fish”. Displays the current fish counts for both players during the game. Other than always having only 2 players, the following the game changes are implemented to make coding the game easier:
- The ice flows will be squares instead of hexes
- The game board will be 6x10 ice flows
- Penguins can move in 8 directions (diagonally and orthogonally) instead of the 6 directions that hexagons would allow
